LeetCode #202: Happy Number
https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/

Problem Statement:
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.
A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

Example 1:
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1

Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: false

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
